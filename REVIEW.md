## Key Features to Review

### 1. User Experience
- **Touch-friendly Design**: All buttons and interactive elements are sized appropriately for mobile
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Clear information hierarchy with proper use of typography and spacing
- **Intuitive Navigation**: Bottom tab bar provides quick access to main features
- **Consistent UI**: All screens follow the same design patterns and styling

### 2. Feature Completeness
- **Maintenance Requests**: Full workflow from creation to tracking
- **Billing**: Clear presentation of financial information with action buttons
- **Events**: Calendar-style presentation with booking capabilities

## Known Limitations (Expected at This Stage)

1. **Static Data**: All data is currently hardcoded for demonstration
2. **No Authentication**: Login/Register screens are UI only (no backend)
3. **No API Integration**: Backend services not yet connected
4. **Limited Interactions**: Some actions show UI but don't perform operations
5. **No Data Persistence**: App state resets on reload

## Next Steps for Development

### Immediate Priorities
1. Set up backend API or Firebase for data management
2. Implement authentication flow with real credentials
3. Add state management for app-wide data
4. Connect screens to real data sources

### Short-term Goals
1. Implement image upload for maintenance requests
2. Add push notification system
3. Create real-time messaging functionality
4. Integrate payment gateway

### Long-term Goals
1. Add offline support with local caching
2. Implement analytics tracking
3. Add automated testing suite
4. Set up CI/CD pipeline
